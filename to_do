## to do
use only severe YBOCS for t feat selection, but train with those feats on wider train set

ml experience : learning : can build up insights for further more focused analysis i.e. t feats inform further learning
or simple clustering informs what features to focus on ... and reduces much searchin in hypothesis space

# recursive feature selection
# Free Surfer Group Analysis

# deep learning on original images

## later if time
# graph model scores against num of features?
# run meta analysis on them? which features seen the most?
