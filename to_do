#------------TO DO------------#

PRIO HIGH
try on hand picked test set and then rest with imbalanced
volume area with class3

median split

just use standard atlas freesurfer
just volume
just area
just thickness

check t test between pat severity
other univariate tests anova f test

median class split wo univariate classification
try hand test set with rest train

try data augmentation with repeating samples
try t test for clf on resamp set



recursive feature selection

train not scaled data

understand who GBR and GBC work for presentation...also XGboost

PRIO MID
try more cv_folds more accuracy? -> cv10 did worse than cv5?

check if GridSearchCV fully taken advantage of?

try some other scoring metrics

Free Surfer Group Analysis

PRIO LOW
use p_values instead? probably doesn't bring much
write Alessandro for his preproc steps, cut down on FS_feats?

#------------DONE------------#
tried ADASYN_clf with t_clf -> results much worse
try again with normed t test : getting .85 .90 accuracy? doesnt make sense with norm because dist all same 0 mean 1 std
correct to sort descending for gbc score? yes
correct to sort ascending for gbr score? yes
- (train not scaled data) remove FS_feats that are sparse or non-informative, or close to zero
bug: why not writing FS_features to excel? -> .save()
why train_test_split on std always same 8 t features? -> is indeed the right calculation
check if GridSearchCV used properly -> indeed
try imbalanced functionality of gridsearch scoring with more training and test samples
t and p values or and? -> and
try just with minMax
use only severe YBOCS pats for t feat selection

#------------ IF TIME LATER------------#
graph model scores against num of features?
run meta analysis on them? which features seen the most?
deep learning on original images

#------------LEARNING------------#
ml experience : learning : can build up insights for further more focused analysis i.e. t feats inform further learning
or simple clustering informs what features to focus on ... and reduces much searchin in hypothesis space

implies doing experiments in steps for faster feedback and informing next ecps instead of doing many experiments at a time...

using only severe YBOCS for t test seems to make accuracy worse

using hand picked balanced

mathe ist sehen dass
t_feats_num_total = t_frame.shape[1]

t_feats_list = t_frame.columns.tolist()
gleich werte sind, also sich gleichen. aber andere konzepten sind mit unterschiedleich folgen und werten unter
anderen Bedingungen
